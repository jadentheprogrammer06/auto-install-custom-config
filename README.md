# custom-autoinstall-linux
**ABOUT**

Script to make it easier when installing or re-installing common third-party software AND games. Prompts the user whether to install any of the included software. Designed for personal-use in Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros. This program may also be given to new-to-Linux-users who just want to go through a wizard that installs commonly useful software for them that they may likely use in the future.

An even cooler feature: It may be used by gamers such as myself who want to quickly install emulators and games without any hassle or friction. I plan on including all gaming software you are likely to need or to use on a linux system.

*Warning: This script still needs to be tested farther. Some farther configuration needs to be done in order for certain programs to install properly. I tried running this on my laptop and many packages do not install properly as they should and some parts were bugged. I will try my best to fix this sometime soon.*
**MORE FACTS**
* *People are free to download this and modify it to suit their needs.* 
* Programs are installed based on stable builds and the recommended sources/repositories. I used the Snap Store for some software since it has newer versions, for example.*
* Right now, this seems good enough for myself and the average Ubuntu/Linux user and/or gamer on modern systems. In the future, I may update this little script/program to be more complex and support a wider variety of systems. This would definitely be nice to use on a fresh Raspberry Pi install.*

# *Batch Install Your Favorite Programs, Productivity Programs &, Multimedia Software!*

* Terminator (Plan on automating custom-terminal add-ons later on)
* OBS, Audacity, Kdenlive
* GIMP, Krita
* Blender
* VirtualBox (will be implemented later)
* May also add Atom, PyCharm, Emacs / {insert other development software}. (will be implemented later)
# *Confusion-Free Gaming Setup!*

  * RetroArch
  * Dolphin
  * PCSX2
  * Citra (will be implemented later)
*  You can install Linux-supported PC games software.
  * Steam (will be implemented later)
  * Lutris / WINE (will be implemented later)
*  Automatically install best gaming drivers and modifications for your system. (MIGHT be implemented later. This seems a bit complicated. I would appreciate some help in the future for trying to implement some of these features into my script! :D )
# You can install All Minecraft Versions and games available right on linux, including:
  * Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Linux port of Android version, requires Play Store copy. Has Crossplatform-Play and Consistent Performance.)
  * Minecraft Java Edition for PC. (*The original game*. Natively supported & Has Large Mod Support. No Crossplatform-play with consoles/bedrock.)
