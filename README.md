# custom-autoinstall-linux
**ABOUT**

This program is a basic wizard that prompts the user to easily batch-install common third-party software and games. This makes the process much easier & saves them a lot of time in the future.

**Designed for personal-use in Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros, on AMD64 systems. This program is very useful to new-to-linux users and powerusers alike.**

An even cooler feature: It may be used by gamers such as myself who want to quickly install emulators and games without any hassle or friction. I plan on including all gaming software you are likely to need or to use on a linux system. Some software may also be easier to install since the program downloads & compiles/depackages it for you. (PCSX2 being the main example)

* *Warning: This program is still a work-in-progress. You may encounter some bugs depending on your installation and setup.*

**MORE FACTS**
* *People are free to download this and modify/fork it to suit their needs.* 
* Programs are installed based on stable builds and the recommended package-managers/software-repositories. *I used the Snap Store for some software since it has newer, updated versions, for example.*
* In the future, I may update this program to be more compatible and support a wider variety of systems. This would definitely be nice to use on a fresh Raspberry Pi install. Common software like GIMP & RetroArch will probably install fine on most systems. *This is mainly a problem with software like the Minecraft Bedrock Edition launcher, which has builds & installation-processes for each archetecture. Some programs also don't run well on lower-end hardware.*

# *Batch Install Your Favorite Programs, Productivity Programs &, Multimedia Software!*
* **Brave Browser** (Much better than Chrome. One of the smoothest and most privacy-respecting secure browsers!)
* **Vim & Git** (*Not installed on some distros by default.*)
* **Terminator** (Plan on automating custom-terminal add-ons later on)
* **OBS, Audacity, Kdenlive** - Video Editing
* **GIMP, Krita** - Image Editors
* **Blender** - 3D Modeling
* **VirtualBox** - Virtualization for running work/test environments and distro-hopping. (will be implemented later)
* May also add **Atom, PyCharm, Emacs, VS-Code, Sublime-Text, etc.** (will be implemented later, I don't yet have a personal use for full-fledged IDEs that can't be solved with good old vim or text editors. Everyone also has their own preferences so it seems unnecesarry.)
# *Confusion-Free Gaming Setup!*
* You can install common game emulator programs: 
  * **RetroArch**
  * **Dolphin**
  * **PCSX2**
  * **Citra** (will be implemented later)
  * **EmulationStation** (will be implemented later)
* You can install Linux-supported PC gaming software.
  * **Steam** (will be implemented later)
  * **Lutris / WINE** (will be implemented later)
*  Automatically install best gaming drivers, software-builds, and modifications for your system. (MIGHT be implemented later. This seems a bit complicated. I would appreciate some help in the future for trying to implement some of these features into my script! :D )
# You can install All Minecraft Versions and games available right on linux, including:
* **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** (Linux port of Android version, requires Play Store copy. Has Crossplatform-Play and Consistent Performance.)
* **Minecraft Java Edition for PC.** (*The original game*. Natively supported & Has Large Mod Support. No Crossplatform-play with consoles/bedrock.)
* **Free & Open-Source Minecraft clone "minetest"** (try it out sometime! It is fairly lightweight, has some mods, and most importantly is free.)
