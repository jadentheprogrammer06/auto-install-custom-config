# custom-autoinstall-linux
**ABOUT**

Script to make it easier when installing or re-installing common third-party software AND games. Prompts the user whether to install any of the included software. Designed for personal-use in Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros. This program may also be given to new-to-Linux-users who just want to go through a wizard that installs commonly useful software for them that they may likely use in the future.

An even cooler feature: It may be used by gamers such as myself who want to quickly install emulators and games without any hassle or friction. I plan on including all gaming software you are likely to need or to use on a linux system. Some software may also be easier to install since the program downloads & compiles/depackages it for you. (PCSX2 being the main example)

* *Warning: This program should work & install properly on a regular Ubuntu/AMD64 system but you may encounter some bugs depending on what distro and system you are using, as well as what package managers are installed.*

**MORE FACTS**
* *People are free to download this and modify/fork it to suit their needs.* 
* Programs are installed based on stable builds and the recommended package-managers/software-repositories. *I used the Snap Store for some software since it has newer, updated versions, for example.*
* Right now, this seems good enough for myself and the average Ubuntu-Linux user on modern systems. In the future, I may update this program to be more compatible and support a wider variety of systems. This would definitely be nice to use on a fresh Raspberry Pi install.*

# *Batch Install Your Favorite Programs, Productivity Programs &, Multimedia Software!*
* **Brave Browser** (Much better than Chrome. One of the smoothest and most privacy-respecting secure browsers!)
* **Vim & Git** (*Not installed on some distros by default.*)
* **Terminator** (Plan on automating custom-terminal add-ons later on)
* **OBS, Audacity, Kdenlive** - Video Editing
* **GIMP, Krita** - Image Editors
* **Blender** - 3D Modeling
* **VirtualBox** - Virtualization for running work/test environments and distro-hopping. (will be implemented later)
* May also add **Atom, PyCharm, Emacs, VS-Code, Sublime-Text, etc.** (will be implemented later, I don't yet have a personal use for full-fledged IDEs that can't be solved with good old vim or text editors. Everyone also has their own preferences so it seems unnecesarry.)
# *Confusion-Free Gaming Setup!*
* You can install common game emulator programs: 
  * **RetroArch**
  * **Dolphin**
  * **PCSX2**
  * **Citra** (will be implemented later)
  * **EmulationStation** (will be implemented later)
* You can install Linux-supported PC gaming software.
  * **Steam** (will be implemented later)
  * **Lutris / WINE** (will be implemented later)
*  Automatically install best gaming drivers, software-builds, and modifications for your system. (MIGHT be implemented later. This seems a bit complicated. I would appreciate some help in the future for trying to implement some of these features into my script! :D )
# You can install All Minecraft Versions and games available right on linux, including:
* **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** (Linux port of Android version, requires Play Store copy. Has Crossplatform-Play and Consistent Performance.)
  * **Minecraft Java Edition for PC.** (*The original game*. Natively supported & Has Large Mod Support. No Crossplatform-play with consoles/bedrock.)
  * **Free & Open-Source Minecraft clone "minetest"** (try it out sometime! It is fairly lightweight, has some mods, and most importantly is free.)
