# custom-autoinstall-linux - Program that easily batch-installs most commonly used Linux software/utilities & PC Gaming/Emulation Software. No friction in your installation!

# Installation Instructions. 
  **This program is primarily designed for AMD64 systems running UBUNTU.**
  1. **Download this repository and extract the zip archive.**
  * ***OR git clone this repository, if you wish.***
  2. **Run this installation script:** ```./install-update-script.sh```
  
  3. **The program is now available as a terminal command: ```custom-autoinstall-linux```. Run it to install whatever you need.**
  
  4. **Keep ```install-update-script.sh``` somewhere safe if you want to use it to update or remove your local install in the future.**
  * I recommend moving ```install-update-script.sh``` and/or ```custom-autoinstall-linux``` to an external hard drive for convenience sake when installing the program on a new computer or fresh Ubuntu install so you can get full usage out of your devices.
  * If you know how you can manually install the program and modify it as you wish.

# ABOUT

* **This program is a basic wizard that prompts the user to batch-install common third-party software and games. This makes the process much easier & saves them a lot of time in the future. Designed for new-to-linux users and power-users alike. People are free to download this and also modify/fork it to suit their needs.**

* This program is designed around stability and reliability in personal-use on **Ubuntu, AMD64 systems** alone. *How this program runs on other distros & systems might not be as reliable due to using Ubuntu-recommended package-repositories, including the snap store. In other words: **If using something other than Ubuntu & AMD64-architecture, expect bugs.***

* In the future, I may make branches or updates to this program for it to be more compatible with other systems and/or distros. (Expect to see a Raspberry Pi branch! :D ) This may also include allowing people to input their own commands and software through a csv file.

# *Batch Install Your Favorite Programs & Software!*
* **Brave Browser** (Much better than Chrome. One of the smoothest and most privacy-respecting secure browsers!)
* **Terminator** (Plan on automating custom-terminal add-ons later on)
* **OBS, Audacity, Kdenlive** - Video Editing
* **GIMP, Krita** - Image Editors
* **Blender** - 3D Modeling
* **Syncthing** - Easily sync files between your devices. Free & Open-Source. Is more private/secure than the cloud. Highly Recommend.
* **VirtualBox** - Virtualization for running work/test environments and distro-hopping.
* **Wireshark** - Packet sniffing tool
* **BalenaEtcher** - Flash ISOs to external drive.
# *Confusion-Free PC-Gaming & Emulation!*
* You can install common game emulator programs: 
  * **RetroArch - Emulates almost any retro/classic gaming console you need.**
  * **Dolphin - Emulates GCN/Wii.**
  * **PCSX2 - Emulates PS2.**
  * **Citra - Emulates 3DS.**
* You can install Linux-supported PC gaming software:
  * **Steam - Linux PC Gaming.**
  * **Minecraft - Voxel Sandbox Game** - (See Below!)
  * **Ltris - Linux Tetris Clone** (will be implemented later)
* Automatically install recommended drivers and configurations. (Might be implemented later. This seems complicated)  
# You can install All Minecraft Versions/games available right on linux, including:
* **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** (Linux port of Android version, requires Play Store copy. Has Crossplatform-Play and Consistent Performance.)
* **Minecraft Java Edition for PC.** (*The original game*. Natively supported & Has Large Mod Support. No Crossplatform-play with consoles/bedrock.)
* **FOSS Minecraft clone "minetest"** (Try it out sometime. It is fairly lightweight, has some mods, and most importantly is free.)

# Known Bugs.
* This will probably not work on other distros and systems, unless you fork and modify the code for that system.
