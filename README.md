# custom-autoinstall-linux
***Program that easily installs Useful Linux Programs & PC Gaming/Emulation Software. No friction in your installation!***

# About  
  **This program is primarily designed for AMD64 systems running UBUNTU.**
  * **However, People are free to download this and modify/fork it to suit their needs.**
  **I am currently also designing this program for Raspberry Pi and its official OS.**

# Installation Instructions.   
  1. **Download this repository and extract the zip archive.**
  * ***OR git clone this repository, if you wish.***
  2. **Run this installation script:** ```./install-update-script.sh```
  
  3. **The program is now available as a terminal command: ```custom-autoinstall-linux```. Run it to install whatever you need.**
  
  4. **Keep ```install-update-script.sh``` somewhere safe if you want to use it to update or remove your local install in the future.**
  * I recommend moving ```install-update-script.sh``` and/or ```custom-autoinstall-linux``` to an external hard drive for convenience sake when installing the program on a new computer or fresh Ubuntu install so you can get full usage out of your devices.
